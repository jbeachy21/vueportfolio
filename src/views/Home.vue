    <p class="body-1">I have been interested in science, computers, and technology in general since 
      before I can remember.  If I were however, to pinpoint a time when my interest was first sparked 
      it would be when my brother and I first started to play our Nintendo 64.  Since then, my interest 
      has skyrocketed, in middle school and high school I started experimenting with the terminal on my 
      computer, by the end of high school I was taking an intro to computer science concepts class and my 
      freshman year of college I took an introduction to computer science course taught in python.  
      Although, I did not major in computer science but in chemistry because I wanted a science 
      background as well. After college, I attended the Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp 
      at the University of Minnesota and graduated from that program in May 2019.  Since starting my bootcamp 
      I have made numerous web applications, relearned python, interned at a cryptocurrency startup, and 
      even tinkered with a raspberry pi, (late to the party yeah I know) making a retropie. I am now very 
      excited for my first full time development opportunity and making my dream a reality.
